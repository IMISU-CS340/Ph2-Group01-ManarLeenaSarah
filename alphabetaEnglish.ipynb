    "This tutorial is an AI project that concerns with the needing of supporting materials regarding to the few resources for the computer students. As you see in the title, we will use a special kind of search(Adversarial search)!but, what is adversarial search and what its relationship with games? we will see the answer in the next subsection.\n",

    " \"Adversarial search is a search, where we examine the problem which arises when we try to plan ahead of the world and other agents are planning against us\".[1] So, we can infer that we deal with multiagent environment, this environment could be cooperative or competitive, the adversarial search from its name concerns with competitive multiagent environment.\n",
    " The adversarial search also known as Games! because it works as follow: search in which two or more players each  of have a goal, are trying to explore the same search space for the winning.\n",

    "We choose a familiar game for everyone which is Tic-Tac-Toe (XO) to be our problem, its a Zero-Sum game, which is characterized as follow:\n",
    "+ deterministic (the next state can be determined from the current state).\n",
    "+ fully observable (the player can see everything in the environment).\n",
    "+  adversarial search with pure competition one player win and the other loss.\n",

    "What is formulation? \"It is the process of determining the constituent parts of a problem: its important factors and variables, and the interrelationships between them\"[2], like initial state, goal state, actions and transaction model. You will see how we formulate the game to apply it on different algorithms.\n",

    "#### 3.1. Alpha beta pruning\n",
    "\n",
    "Is a kind of adversarial search that enhanced Minimax algorithm. The Minimax algorithm is also kind of adversarial search that is work as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "The player works to maximize its performance, but the opponent will work to minimize the player performance, Minimax algorithm generate the whole search tree. Some of the problems have a huge search space, Alphabeta comes with idea of pruning to reduce the search space and guarantee the same output of Minimax.\n",
    "So, what is pruning? It’s the procedure of cutting unnecessary node that won’t affect the final result from a tree, it is used to reduce the search space. We will see the pruning in the chosen initial state.\n",
    "The algorithm is known as Alphabeta because in pruning it depends on two variables; alpha and beta:\n",
    "Alpha: The best (highest-value) choice we have found so far at any point along the path of Maximizer. The initial value of alpha is -∞.\n",
    "Beta: The best (lowest-value) choice we have found so far at any point along the path of Minimizer. The initial value of beta is +∞.[3]\n",
    "The pruning happens if the following condition true: alpha>=beta.\n",

    "<a id=\"eva\"></a>\n",
    "#### 3.2. Evaluation function\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation function is also referred as utility function. As mentioned before, it defines the values of terminal states.\n",
    "If we have small search space, we can define it in three conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "If X win return a number that>0.\n",
    "\n",
    "If no one win return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "If O win return a number that<0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some problems are complex and have huge search space, it may take long time to reach the terminal states. We generate the tree to a specific depth (called horizon) and use the utility function with heuristic to evaluate each different state in horizon level, one of the ways to calculate the values in horizon level is f(n)=heuristic of max-heuristic of min. The heuristic represents the total number of columns and rows available for a player to win in a given state. The following image is an example of a heuristic calculation method.\n",
